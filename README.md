#### One page scrolling site

The project was inspired by sites like these below where you can just scroll and watch the story:

http://www.framescollection.com/tunnelrats.html

http://whois.wildlife.la

This also gave me the opportunity to experiment with [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/kab/docs/Web/SVG) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com). After short research [scrollmagic](http://scrollmagic.io/docs/index.html) was chosen to wrap scrolling logic.
